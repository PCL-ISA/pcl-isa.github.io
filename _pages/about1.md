Dr. Haofei Wang is an associate researcher and PhD advisor at Pengcheng Laboratory (PCL). Before joining PCL, he earned his PhD in ECE from [The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology](https://www.ust.hk) (HKUST) and Bachelor in Automation with Chu Kochen Honors from [Zhejiang University](https://www.zju.edu.cn) (ZJU).

Haofei's primary research objective is to enable robots/computers to better understand human intention (brain) and behavior (body), thereby facilitating more natural and effective human-machine interaction. This interdisciplinary endeavor integrates key areas such as human-computer interaction (HCI), virtual reality (VR), and large language model(LLM)-based medical data processing. By exploring novel interaction paradigms, immersive virtual environments, and advanced AI techniques, particularly large language and vision models, the research aims to bridge the cognitive gap between humans and machines. In the medical domain, the study focuses on leveraging large language/vision models to extract meaningful insights from complex healthcare datasets, ultimately supporting intelligent decision-making and personalized healthcare. Our work aspires to lay the foundation for empathetic, context-aware, and human-centered artificial intelligence systems.
